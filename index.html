            <p> Hi,
                Let me introduce myself!
                My name is Hilal tapan and I am 24 years old.
                I have graduated as spatial designer and since 2020 I have been studying Communication
                and Multimedia design. My passions lie in design and programming, that's why I wanna become 
                a front-end developer. Keeping myself busy with all kinds of creative projects is what I like most!
                Take a look at my GitHub repositories
            </p>
